Equations and convention for vector spherical waves is following: Mishchenko, M.I., Travis, L.D., and Lacis, A.A. (2002). Scattering, absorption, and emission of light by small particles (Cambridge University Press).

# Installation
This is not a registered package yet. For now, you can install it by opening an interactive julia session, and type the following commands:

`using Pkg`

`Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/mhmodzoka/ComplexOperations.jl")`

`Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/mhmodzoka/VectorSphericalWaves.jl")`

`Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/mhmodzoka/Tmatrix.jl")`

The first three commands install prerequisites: ComplexOperations.jl and VectorSphericalWaves.jl packages.
The last command installs Tmatrix.jl package.
